# A replacement for FactoryGirl that exclusively creates and updates data using
# our own operations, and therefore creates data in the exact same way that a
# user would. Ideally all test data should be created in this way and we would
# do away with FactoryGirl altogether.
#
# The macros in here are long and VERY ugly but they're a start; ideally we'd
# have some kind of unified interface similar to FactoryGirl's "create" method
# that delegates to methods like the one below
#
# Some of these methods have a FactoryGirl-like interface where you can pass
# both 'traits' and 'overrides', but I want to move away from 'traits', they're
# too magical.
