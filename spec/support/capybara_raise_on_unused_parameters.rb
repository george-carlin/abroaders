# If you pass unused parameters to a Capybara selector, e.g.:
#
#     # Note the missing 'href:'
#     is_expected.to have_link "Home", root_path
#
# ... you can get false positives. Capybara will print a warning when you do
# this, but I don't think that's enough; I want these tests to fail explicitly.
# The only solution is to monkey-patch Capybara::Queries::SelectorQuery so that
# it raises an error rather than a warning. Of course, this is hacky behaviour
# that could easily break on the next Capybara upgrade, so run a quick check
# beforehand to make sure a developer remembers this and keeps everything
# up-to-date if we upgrade Capybara.
