# GLOSSARY

There are a few terms within the app that we use in specific ways to avoid
ambiguity. Here are a few (this list is by no means complete):

- "Declined": a card recommendation is **declined** if we recommend a card
  to a user, but they tell us they don't want to apply for for it.  Not to be
  confused with **denied**.
- "Denied": a card recommendation is **denied** if the user applies for the
  card, but the bank rejects their application. Not to be confused with
  **declined**.
