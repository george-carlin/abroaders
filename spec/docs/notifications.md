# Notifications

Use case 1: user receives a notification
1. user sees the notification icon in the header denoting the number of unseen
   notifications
1. user clicks the notification icon and sees a more detailed list of
   notification information
  - alternative flow: user clicks outside the list and the list disappears
1. user clicks on an individual notification
1. user is taken to the page that is relevant to that notification
1. the 'unseen notification' count decreases by 1, and the clicked notification
   no longer appears in the notification list in the navbar.
