  # We have some dataclips on Heroku (dataclips.heroku.com) that get fed into a
  # Google Sheet. They rely on raw SQL, meaning that changes to the DB schema
  # may break them. These tests are here so that if a migration breaks the
  # dataclips I notice immediately. SQL is copied directly from the dataclips
  # to these specs.
  #
  # If one of these specs starts failing, it almost definitely means that the
  # dataclip (and thus the SQL in the spec) needs fixing, not the Rails app
  # itself or the schema.
