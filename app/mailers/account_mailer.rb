# These emails are sent to an email address where they're then detected by
# IfThisThenThat and used to trigger bunch of different APIs, set up by Erik.
# We're doing it this way because it's quicker and easier than writing the Ruby
# to trigger the APIs directly, and it means that Erik can easily tweak the
# IFTTT script without having to use up developer time. Eventually we'll want
# to update things so our app triggers the APIs directly, but it's low
# priority.
