  # Extend `render` (which is already being extended by the trailblazer-rails
  # gem to allow Cells to be rendered directly without going through the
  # ActionView layer) so that if you're directly rendering a cell from the
  # controller and the cell responds to `title` (that's as an instance method,
  # not a class method - `render` deals with instances of the cell, not the
  # cell's class), then the return value of `title` will be stored in an ivar
  # `@cell_title`. This ivar will be used later by TitleHelper to fill the
  # page's <title> tag.
  #
  # This is the solution, for now, to how we can provide custom <title>s for
  # cell-based pages when the <title> tag itself lives in an ActionView
  # template. (The standard AV approach with `provide` doesn't work, or at
  # least I couldn't get it to work.) This is kinda hacky but I can't see a
  # better way for now. If we ever manage to completely remove the ActionView
  # layer and use Cells for everything including the layout, we can probably
  # remove this override:
  def render(cell = nil, opts = {}, *, &block)
    if cell.is_a?(::Cell::ViewModel) && cell.respond_to?(:title)
      @cell_title = cell.title
    end

  # Since upgrading to Ruby 2.4.0, rails prints warnings EVERYWHERE with

  # ActionController::Base, but forwardable expects it to be public. Making the
  # method public may not be the ideal solution (really this is an issue in
  # rails that should be fixed, as far as I can tell), but it suppresses the
  # warnings:
  public :protect_against_forgery?
