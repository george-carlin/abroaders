        This question is to understand if it is possible for you to open
        rewards cards in the United States.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should only answer that you are not eligible if you cannot open a
        credit card because you do not have a social security number in the US.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weâ€™ll ask about whether you would like recommendations for rewards
        cards later in the survey.
