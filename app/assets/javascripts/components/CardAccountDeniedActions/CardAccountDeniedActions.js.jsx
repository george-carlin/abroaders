          We strongly recommend that you call BANK at BANK PERSONAL/BIZ PHONE
          as soon as possible to ask for a real person to review your
          application by phone.

        <p>
          More than 30% of applications that are initially denied are
          overturned with a 5-10 minute phone call.
