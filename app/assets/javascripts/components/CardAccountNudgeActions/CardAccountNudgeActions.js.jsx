        <p>
          We strongly recommend that you call BANK at BANK PERSONAL/BIZ PHONE
          as soon as possible to ask for a real person to review your
          application by phone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Youâ€™re more than twice as likely to get approved if you call BANK
          than if you wait for them to send your decision in the mail
        </p>
