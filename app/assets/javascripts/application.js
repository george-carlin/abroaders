window.components = {
  CardApplicationSurvey:     require("./components/CardApplicationSurvey"),
  AccountTypeForm:           require("./components/AccountTypeForm"),
};

window.numbro = require("numbro");

// Note that something more DRY like this won't work:
//
// window.components = {}
//
// _.each([
//   "CardAccountApplyOrDecline",
//   "CardApplicationSurvey",
//   "AccountTypeForm"
//  ], function (name) {
//   window.components[name] = require(`./components/${name}`);
// });
//
// ... because Browserify's 'require' statement must be passed a string literal.
