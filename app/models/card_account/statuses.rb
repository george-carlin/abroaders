module CardAccount::Statuses
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  # 'declined' means the user would not, or could not, apply for the card
  #            which we recommended to them.
  # 'denied' means that the user applied for the card, but the application
  #          was denied by the bank.

  # Here's the way which a card account may pass through the statuses:
  #
  # (statuses in brackets may be skipped. The boolean after the comma
  # is the value of the 'reconsidered' column.)
  #
  # recommended, false
  #     ├─▸ declined, false
  #     ├─▸ denied, false
  #     │     ├─▸ declined, true
  #     │     ├─▸ denied, true
  #     │     └─▸ open, true
  #     │           └─▸ closed, true
  #     └─▸ open, false
  #           └─▸ closed, false

  # TODO confirm with Erik: in previous sketches, we had an extra
  # stage called 'pending_decision', but for the sake of simplicity
  # I've decided not to store it. Can we get away with this?
