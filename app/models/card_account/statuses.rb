  # 'declined' means the user would not, or could not, apply for the card
  #            which we recommended to them.
  # 'denied' means that the user applied for the card, but the application
  #          was denied by the bank.

  # Here's the way which a card account may pass through the statuses:
  #
  # (statuses in brackets may be skipped)
  #
  # recommended
  #     ├─▸ declined
  #     └─▸ (pending_decision)
  #              ├─▸ denied
  #              │     ├─▸ declined_to_apply_for_reconsideration
  #              │     └─▸ (pending_reconsideration_decision)
  #              │           ├─▸ denied_after_reconsideration
  #              │           └─▸ approved_after_reconsideration
  #              └─▸ approved (AKA = currently working on bonus challenge)
  #                    └─▸ closed
