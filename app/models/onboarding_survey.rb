# A representation of the "onboarding survey" - the series of forms that a user
# must fill in when they first sign up to the app. The 'pages' method
# returns a list of all possible pages in the survey, in the order that a user
# should visit them.
#
# Call `current_account#onboarding_survey` to get the onboarding survey info
# for the currently logged-in user. This instance will be used to:
#
#   1. Determine whether or not the user has completed the survey.
#   2. If they haven't completed the survey, figure out which page they need
#      be redirected to.
#
# Note that not all users will have to fill in all pages of the survey; their
# answers to questions on earlier pages will determine if they need to fill in
# later pages. (E.g. users who don't add a companion won't have to fill in any
# of the forms related to their companion, and users who are ineligible to
# apply for cards don't need to fill in the 'spending info' or 'cards' pages.)
# If the user doesn't need to fill in a particular page, then Page#required?
# will return false. If the user has already completed a particular page, then
# Page#complete? will return true.
#
# The `pages` method should be the central, canonical representation of all
# pages in the onboarding survey (note: the structure of the onboarding survey,
# in terms of the business requirements, has changed multiple times in the past
# and is likely to change again in future).
