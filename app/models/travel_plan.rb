# An upcoming flight or series of flights that the user wants to take.  Can be
# 'single', 'return', or 'multi' (multi-leg) - these names are
# self-explanatory.  However, note that there's no way to actually create a
# 'multi' travel plan at present through the normal web-based flow of the app.
# We've postponed this feature as it's low-priority and MUCH more complicated
# than single/return in terms of interface design.
#
# A TravelPlan has_many Flights, and each Flight has a 'from' destination and a
# 'to' destination. This is where the information about the user's desired
# destinations is stored (i.e. it's not stored directly on the travel plan.)
# Note that both 'single' and 'return' travel plans only have one associated
# flight (i.e. return flights don't have 2 flights; this would just be
# redundant data since the second flight would always just be the first flight
# with 'from' and 'to' swapped). Since there aren't any 'multi' TravelPlans in
# the current app, there are also by definition no TravelPlans with more than
# one associated Flight.
