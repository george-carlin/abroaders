# Identity object. Since the list of Banks is small, will rarely change, and
# has very little information to store about each bank, a full-blown
# database-backed model is overkill. Instead the list of Banks is stored as a
# constant (TABLE) and Bank has a minimal set of methods to make it quack like
# an ActiveRecord model as far as Card is concerned (so we can get methods like
# Card#bank, Bank.find(id).cards, etc)

  # Note that only odd numbers are used for card IDs. This is because each card

  # number that represents the bank - but there are two numbers per bank, one
  # for personal cards are one for business cards. We're using odd numbers for
  # personal and even numbers for business - so e.g. a Chase personal card's
  # identifier will start with '01' while a Chase business card's identifier
  # will start with '02'
