# A Card is a specific copy of a CardProduct. If 10 people have a Chase
# Sapphire credit card, then there are 10 Cards (one in each person's wallet),
# but only one card *product* (the general concept of a Chase Sapphire card).
class Card < ApplicationRecord
  # A card has the following timestamps, all of which are nullable:
  #
  # opened_on:
  #   the date the user was approved for the card and their account was opened.
  #   the actual name of the DB column is 'opened_on', opened_on is an alias.
  #
  # earned_at:
  #   the date the user earned their signup bonus. (It might be the same date
  #   they opened the card, if the offer is 'on approval')
  #
  # closed_on:
  #   the date the user's card expired or they closed the card's account.
  #   the actual name of the DB column is 'closed_on', closed_on is an alias.
  #
  # created_at/updated_at
  #   The normal Rails/PSQL timestamp columns. But you already knew that ;)

  # Associations

  # All Cards have a CardProduct and, if the user has the card because we
  # recommended it to them, the Card will also be associated with a particular
  # offer.
  #
  # An Offer also belongs_to a Card:roduct, so a Card with an offer is only
  # valid if the offer belongs to the right product. This results in a slightly
  # denormalized DB schema (because product_id will always equal
  # offer.product_id if offer is not nil, so product_id can sometimes contain
  # redundant data), but as far as I can tell this is necessary evil, because
  # all cards have a product, and all offers have a product, but not all cards
  # have an offer.
