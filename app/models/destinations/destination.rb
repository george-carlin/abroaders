  # even though they're not countries in real life. (The US is named "United
  # States (Continental 48)". This is to simplify the code in the travel plan
  # form, so we can just call Country.all and not have to worry
  # about including Alaska and Hawaii separately. In the future when the travel
  # plan form setup is more complicated, we may change them to regions.
