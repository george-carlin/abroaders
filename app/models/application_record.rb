  # We're deviating from The Rails Wayâ„¢ (gasp!) by keeping validations out
  # of our ActiveRecord models and leaving them for the form layer (i.e.  TRB
  # ops + Reform.) This means we can afford to be defensive and disallow
  # invalid state from being set in the first place, because Invalid Object Is
  # An Anti-Pattern:

  # We don't need to go overboard and set this for every single attribute,
  # but where appropriate you can use this with dry-types:
  #
  #     CreditScore = Types::Strict::Int.constrained(gteq: 350, lteq: 850)
  #
  #     class SpendingInfo < ApplicationRecord
  #       attribute_type :credit_score, CreditScore
  #     end
  #
  #     SpendingInfo.new(credit_score: 349)
  #     # => Dry::Types::ConstraintError
  #     SpendingInfo.new(credit_score: 851)
  #     # => Dry::Types::ConstraintError
  #     SpendingInfo.new(credit_score: 850)
  #     # => #<SpendingInfo credit_score: 850>
