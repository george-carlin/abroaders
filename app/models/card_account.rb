  # Attributes

  # 'declined' means the user would not, or could not, apply for the card
  #            which we recommended to them.
  # 'denied' means that the user applied for the card, but the application
  #          was denied by the bank.
  #
  # Note that the numeric keys of the statuses don't necessarily match
  # the order in which a card account flows through the statuses, because
  # some statuses were added later in the app's development than others.

  # Associations

  # All CardAccounts have a card. When we recommend a card to a user, then the
  # CardAccount will also have an offer, and the card account's card will be
  # equal to the offer's card.
  #
  # To handle this, we're slightly denormalizing the DB schema. The
  # `card_accounts` table has columns `card_id` and `offer_id`. When the card
  # has an offer, `card_id` will be equal to `offer.card_id`, which is set by a
  # callback and reinforced by a validation.
  #
  # Previously we were trying to avoid this 'redundant' data by leaving card_id
  # blank when offer_id was present and getting the card directly from the
  # other, but this created some subtle bugs, mainly that person.cards or
  # account.cards would *only* return cards that were from a card account with
  # no offer. So instead we're now *always* storing card_id even when we
  # technically don't need to.
  #
  # I'm open to suggestions for how we can handle this better.
