  # Validations

  # Exactly one of card_id and offer_id should be present - because if
  # we know the offer, we can get the card through the offer instead of 
  # saving the card directly.
  #
  # In practice, all card accounts created through the recommendation system
  # will have an offer; the only times we *won't* know the offer are:
  #
  # a) when the user tells us about his pre-existing card accounts on signup.
  # b) for the legacy data we had when the app was first created.
