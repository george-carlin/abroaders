# A 'card account' is the join table between a Person and a Card.
#
# Note that 'card account' is the terminology we use internally to distinguish
# this model from a Card, but from the user's point of view he doesn't care
# about 'card accounts', he just thinks that he 'has cards'. (This is why, for
# example, the user accesses the card_accounts#index page at the path '/cards',
# not at '/card_accounts/')
class CardAccount < ApplicationRecord
  extend Expiration

  # A card account has the following timestamps, all of which are nullable:
  #
  # recommended_at:
  #   the date the admin recommended the card to the user. May be null,
  #   if the user added the card in the onboarding survey, or if the admin
  #   assigned the card to the user 'manually' (not through the recommendation
  #   system), e.g. to handle legacy data.
  #
  # clicked_at:
  #   the date the user clicked the 'apply' button on the card recommendation
  #   page. Note that we don't know for sure that they actually applied, just
  #   that they clicked the link. (We have to rely on them coming back and
  #   telling us that they applied).
  #
  # declined_at:
  #   For whatever reason, a user might not want to apply for the card we
  #   recommend to them. If that's the case, they have option to 'decline' the
  #   card and tell us why. This timestamp tells us when they declined.
  #   (There's also a 'decline_reason' text field for them to say why they're
  #   declining.)
  #
  # applied_at:
  #   the date the user *applied* for the card (according to them).
  #
  # opened_at:
  #   the date the user was approved for the card and their account was opened.
  #
  # earned_at:
  #   the date the user earned their signup bonus. (It might be the same date
  #   they opened the account, if the offer is 'on approval')
  #
  # closed_at:
  #   the date the user's card expired or they closed the account.
  #
  # denied_at:
  #   If the user applied for the card but their application was denied,
  #   this timestamp tells us when.
  #
  # nudged_at:
  #   If the user applies for the card but doesn't hear back immediately,
  #   we encourage them to call the bank to speed up the application process.
  #   If they tell us they've called, then 'nudged_at' is the date they called.
  #   Note that nudged_at is distinct from 'called_at', explained below:
  #
  # called_at
  #   If the user applies and is *denied* (as opposed to just not having
  #   heard back yet), we also encourage them to call and see if the application
  #   can be reconsidered. In this case we set the called_at timestamp, not the
  #   nudged_at timestamp.
  #
  #   So in brief: a 'nudge' is when they call the bank about a *pending*
  #   application. A 'call' is when they call the bank about a *denied*
  #   application. (If they nudge and then are denied, we don't encourage them
  #   to call again. They should only call if the application was denied
  #   without nudging. So nudged_at and called_at will never both be present)
  #
  #   NOTE: the distinction between 'nudging' and 'calling' is a code-level
  #   thing that should only matter to developers. From the point of view of
  #   the business and the non-technical stakeholders, both actions are
  #   considered to be 'calling', and non-developers don't need to know about
  #   the terminology 'nudge'. We're using this internal distinction because it
  #   makes it much easier to track a user's actions and figure out where they
  #   are in the application survey.
  #
  # redenied_at
  #   If the user is denied, calls, and gets denied again, this is the date
  #   they were denied for the second time. We need this column for two
  #   reasons: 1) it's the only way to distinguish between a user who has
  #   called for reconsideration, and a user who has been denied again after
  #   calling for reconsideration - and 2) we need to preserve the original
  #   denied_at timestamp because that's what determines when the user can
  #   apply again
  #
  # expired_at
  #   Cards which are recommended but not clicked within 15 days are assumed to
  #   be declined. But for the sake of record-keeping, we mark this with a
  #   separate time column, rather than reusing 'declined_at' (in which case it
  #   would be unclear whether the user declined the card manually or it was
  #   declined automatically). Note that 'expiry' in this sense has nothing to
  #   do with the expiry date that's printed on a bank card.
  #
  # created_at/updated_at
  #   The normal Rails/PSQL timestamp columns. But you already knew that ;)

  # Associations

  # All CardAccounts have a card. When we recommend a card to a user, then the
  # CardAccount will also have an offer, and the card account's card will be
  # equal to the offer's card.
  #
  # To handle this, we're slightly denormalizing the DB schema. The
  # `card_accounts` table has columns `card_id` and `offer_id`. When the card
  # has an offer, `card_id` will be equal to `offer.card_id`, which is set by a
  # callback and reinforced by a validation.
  #
  # Previously we were trying to avoid this 'redundant' data by leaving card_id
  # blank when offer_id was present and getting the card directly from the
  # other, but this created some subtle bugs, mainly that person.cards or
  # account.cards would *only* return cards that were from a card account with
  # no offer. So instead we're now *always* storing card_id even when we
  # technically don't need to.
  #
  # I'm open to suggestions for how we can handle this better.

  # Scopes

  # There are currently two ways that a card can be added to a user's account:
  # they can add it on the onboarding survey, or it can be recommended to them
  # by an admin. We know which source the CardAccount came from because
  # recommended_at will be nil in the former case and present in the latter.
