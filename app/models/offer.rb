require 'types'

# A sign-up offer that banks etc. use to entice people to sign up for a
# particular card product. For example, "spend $1000 on this card in your first
# 3 months and receive 50,000 free points with Airline X".
#
# There are different ways you can get the bonus, as noted in the 'condition'
# attribute:
#
# on_approval:       points awarded as soon as approved for card
# on_first_purchase: points awarded once you make 1st purchase with card
# on_minimum_spend:  points awarded if you spend $X within Y days
#
# It's also possible that a user will tell us that they have a particular card
# but doesn't tell us which offer they used to sign up with, in which case
# the condition will be 'unknown'. If it's a card that we recommended to them,
# however, we will always know the condition.
#
# Whether or not the other attributes will be present depends on the condition:
#
# 'spend' = the minimum that the person has to spend using the card
#           to get the bonus (not relevant for 'on approval' cards)
# 'days'  = how long the user has after opening the card account to spend enough
#           money to earn the bonus. (Only relevant for 'on_minimum_spend' cards)
#
# 'cost' is the card's annual fee for the first year. The 'normal' annual fee
# is reflected in the 'annual_fee' attribute of the CardProduct, but typically
# the annual fee will be waived in the first year, so the offer reflects this.
#
# 'link' is the link to the page where people can sign up for the cards.  NOTE:
# any links from our app to the card application page MUST be nofollowed, for
# compliance reasons.
