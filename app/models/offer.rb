require 'types'

# A sign-up offer that banks etc. use to entice people to sign up for a
# particular card product. For example, "spend $1000 on this card in your first
# 3 months and receive 50,000 free points with Airline X".
#
# There are different ways you can get the bonus, as noted in the 'Condition'
# type (see inline comments).
#
# Whether or not the other attributes will be present depends on the condition:
#
# 'spend' = the minimum that the person has to spend using the card
#           to get the bonus (not relevant for 'on approval' cards)
# 'days'  = how long the user has after opening the card account to spend enough
#           money to earn the bonus. (Only relevant for 'on_minimum_spend' cards)
#
# 'cost' is the card's annual fee for the first year. The 'normal' annual fee
# is reflected in the 'annual_fee' attribute of the CardProduct, but typically
# the annual fee will be waived in the first year, so the offer reflects this.
#
# 'link' is the link to the page where people can sign up for the cards.  NOTE:
# any links from our app to the card application page MUST be nofollowed, for
# compliance reasons.
#
# See the `Condition` constant for more info about '#condition'.
#
# Generally I use 'condition' to refer to that specific attribute, and
# 'conditions' to refer collectively to `condition`, `spend`, `days`,
# `points_awarded`, `cost` and `card_product_id`, which are the relevant
# attributes to know the bonus conditions and reward that the user gets for
# the sign-up.
