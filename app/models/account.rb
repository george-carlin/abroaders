  # NOTE: the 'onboarded_travel_plans' column will be set to true when the user
  # completes the 'add travel plan' part of the onboarding survey. Originally,
  # we didn't have a separate column, and looked at the account's associated
  # travel plans to see if they'd added any. (i.e. 'onboarded_travel_plans' was
  # considered true `if account.travel_plans.any?`, without an extra DB column
  # to store it explicitly. However, this had a flaw: if a user completed the
  # onboarding survey, then later on *deleted* their travel plans, they would
  # no longer be considered onboarded, even though they should have been.  So
  # now the onboarded-ness of travel plans is stored in a separate DB column.
