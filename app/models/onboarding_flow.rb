# Defines the routes via which the user can move through the onboarding survey.
#
# Example usage:
#
#     flow = OnboardingFlow.build(account)
#     flow.add_home_airports!
#
# `flow.add_home_airports!` will return the new state after adding home
# airports - or it will raise an error if home airports can not be added given
# the current state.
