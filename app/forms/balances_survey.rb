# Note: This class was created before I invented the 'Form' abstraction. As
# such, it works very differently from the other '*Survey' classes in app/forms.
# I attempted to refactor it to make things more consistent, but decided it
# wasn't worth the trouble.
#
# I'm not even sure *how* to make this behave like a normal 'Form', because,
# unlike the other Forms, we won't know the exact list of fields until runtime
# (because it depends on what's in the Currencies table in the DB).
