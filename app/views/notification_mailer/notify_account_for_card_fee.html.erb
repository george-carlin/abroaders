<p>Hey <%= name %>,</p>
<p>
  This is just a friendly reminder that the annual fee of
  <%= cell(CardProduct::Cell::AnnualFee, @product) %> for <%= your %>
  for <%= your %>
  <%= cell(CardProduct::Cell::FullName, @product, with_bank: true) %> <%= @product.bp %>
  card will post sometime soon.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, you can get the fee waived or earn other compensation by calling the number on the back of your card.</p>
