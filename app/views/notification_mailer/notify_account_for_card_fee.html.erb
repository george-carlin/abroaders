<p>Hey <%= name %>,</p>
<p>
  This is just a friendly reminder that the annual fee of <%= card.annual_fee %> for <%= your %>
  <%= card.full_name(with_bank: true) %> <%= card.bp.downcase %> card will post sometime soon.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, you can get the fee waived or earn other compensation by calling the number on the back of your card.</p>
