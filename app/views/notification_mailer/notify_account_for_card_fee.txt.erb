Hey <%= name %>,

This is just a friendly reminder that the annual fee of <%= card.annual_fee %> for your
<%= card.full_name(with_bank: true) %> <%= card.bp.downcase %> card will post sometime soon.

Sometimes, you can get the fee waived or earn other compensation by calling the number on the back of your card.
For more detail, check out this resource:
