Hey <%= name %>,

This is just a friendly reminder that the annual fee of <%= product.annual_fee %> for <%= your %>
<%= product.full_name(with_bank: true) %> <%= product.bp.downcase %> card will post sometime soon.

Sometimes, you can get the fee waived or earn other compensation by calling the number on the back of your card.
