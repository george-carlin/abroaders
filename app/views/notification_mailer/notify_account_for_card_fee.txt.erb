Hey <%= name %>,

This is just a friendly reminder that the annual fee of
<%= cell(CardProduct::Cell::AnnualFee, @product) %> for <%= your %>
<%= cell(CardProduct::Cell::FullName, @product, with_bank: true) %> <%= product.bp %>
card will post sometime soon.

Sometimes, you can get the fee waived or earn other compensation by calling the number on the back of your card.
