    <p>
      Before we can recommend <%= @name.name %> a credit card to apply for, we
      need to know which cards <%= @name.he_she %> already <%= @name.has %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please select <strong>all</strong> of the credit/debit cards below for
      which <%= @name.name %> <%= @name.has %> been the <strong>primary
      cardholder in the past 24 months</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this question, you <strong>should</strong> include:
      <ul>
        <li>Accounts that are currently open.</li>
        <li>
          Accounts that were opened in the last 24 months, but are now closed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accounts that were opened in the last 24 months, but have been
          changed into another type of card.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Please <strong>do not</strong> include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cards for which <%= @name.name %> <%= @name.was %> not the primary
          cardholder.
          <br />
          <i>
            Example: Your spouse added you as an additional cardholder on his or
            her account.
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>
          Any card <%= @name.name %> opened more than 24 months ago that is
          not currently open.
          <br />
          <i>
            Example: You opened a card 3 years ago, and you closed the account
            yesterday.
          </i>
