    <h1>Are You Eligible to Get Credit Cards?</h1>

    <hr />

    <p>
      This question is to understand if it is possible for you to open
      rewards cards in the United States.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should only answer that you are not eligible if you cannot open a
      credit card because you do not have a social security number in the US.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weâ€™ll ask about whether you would like recommendations for rewards
      cards later in the survey.
