            Banks and credit card companies are constantly changing their
            offers, and sometimes great deals will disappear without prior
            notice. When we recommend a credit card to you, it's important that
            you're willing and able to apply for the card as soon as possible.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            If <%= person.first_name %> is able to apply for the card within the
            next few days, click "I am now ready" below and we'll get working on the card
            recommendation immediately.
