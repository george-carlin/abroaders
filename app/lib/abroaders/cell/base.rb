      # Worth noting here (in case I ever feel compelled to investigate again)
      # that `request.params` and `params` aren't quite the same in Rails.  The
      # former is a HashWithIndifferentAccess, while the latter is an
      # ActionController::Parameters. I imagine they always have the same
      # keys/values as each other but I haven't looked in the Rails source to
      # check.

      # Trailblazer::Cell#params (provided by the cells-rails gem) delegates to
      # controller.params, not controller.request.params.
