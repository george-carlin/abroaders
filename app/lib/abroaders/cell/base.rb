      # If you have multiple cells in an inheritance hierarchy, by default each
      # cell uses its own view:
      #
      #     # renders foo.erb:
      #     class Foo < Abroaders::Cell::Base
      #     end
      #
      #     # renders bar.erb:
      #     class Bar < Foo
      #     end
      #
      # But sometimes you don't want the subclass to use an entirely separate
      # view file, it might just override specific methods that are called
      # within the parent view file. Call this method in the parent class to
      # make all subclasses use the parent's view file.
      #
      #     class Foo < Abroaders::Cell::Base
      #       # makes both cells render foo.erb:
      #       subclasses_use_parent_view!
      #     end

      # Worth noting here (in case I ever feel compelled to investigate again)
      # that `request.params` and `params` aren't quite the same in Rails.  The
      # former is a HashWithIndifferentAccess, while the latter is an
      # ActionController::Parameters. I imagine they always have the same
      # keys/values as each other but I haven't looked in the Rails source to
      # check.
      #
      # Trailblazer::Cell#params (provided by the cells-rails gem) delegates to
      # controller.params, not controller.request.params.
