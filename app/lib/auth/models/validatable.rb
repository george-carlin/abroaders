    # Validatable creates all needed validations for a user email and password.
    # It's optional, given you may want to create the validations by yourself.
    # Automatically validate if the email is present, unique and its format is
    # valid. Also tests presence of password, confirmation and length.
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # Validatable adds the following options to devise_for:
    #
    #   * +email_regexp+: the regular expression used to validate e-mails;
    #   * +password_length+: a range expressing password length. Defaults to 8..72.
