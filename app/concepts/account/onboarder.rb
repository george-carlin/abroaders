# Updates Account#onboarding_state, and defines which new states are possible
# given the current state.
#
# Example usage:
#
#     Account::Onboarder.new(account).add_home_airports!
#
# `add_home_airports!` will update account.onboarding_state to the new
# state after home_airports - or it will raise an error if home airports can
# not be added given the current state.
#
# When updating the account's state to 'complete', sends an email to the
# admin.
#
# Don't use this model when all you need to do is determine whether a given
# account is onboarded or not. Just call `account.onboarded?
