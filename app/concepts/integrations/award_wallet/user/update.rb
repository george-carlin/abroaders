    module User
      # Takes an AwardWalletUser and a Hash of data for that user (as pulled
      # from the AwardWallet API), and updates the user (and sets user.loaded
      # to true).
      #
      # The hash will be a Ruby representation of the JSON string that we get
      # from the AwardWallet API.
      #
      # Note that we don't need an operation that *creates* an
      # AwardWalletUser in this way. AWUs are exclusively created through the
      # 'Callback' operation.
      #
      # This operation doesn't validate the data in any way; it just assumes
      # that we've pulled valid data from the AW API.
      #
      # Will mainly be used in BG jobs and so doesn't have a currently-logged
      # in user.
      #
      # @!method self.call(params, options = {})
      #   @option params [AwardWalletUser] user
      #   @option params [Hash] data the following attrs are required:
      #     `"access_level"`, `"accounts_access_level"`,
      #     `"edit_connection_url"`, `"email"`, `"forwarding_email"`,
      #     `"full_name"`, `"status"`, `"user_name"`.  Anything else will be
      #     ignored. This op also sets the `agent_id' attr of the AWU, which it
      #     figures out by looking in the `edit_connection_url` attribute (it's
      #     not included as a key in the data from the API)
