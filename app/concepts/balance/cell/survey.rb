    # WARNING: HORRIBLE HACK ALERT
    #
    # override the method in cells-erb-0.0.9/lib/cell/erb/template.rb to ensure
    # that *nothing* cell gets HTML-escaped. If I don't do this,
    # f.fields_for doesn't work (everything within the block gets escaped).
    #
    # This appears to be an issue with cells-erb and erbse, see:
    #
    # https://github.com/trailblazer/cells-erb/issues/2
    #
    # I *could* fix this by upgrading to cells-erb 0.1.0 & erbse 0.1.1 but this
    # breaks a whole bunch of other stuff because there's a bug in these newer
    # versions which means they can't handle inline conditionals; see:
    #
    # https://github.com/apotonick/erbse/issues/4
    # https://github.com/trailblazer/cells-erb/issues/5
    #
    # Overriding 'capture' like this is the least-bad solution I could figure
    # out after an hour or two of frustration :/
