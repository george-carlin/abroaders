module Readiness
  # The page on the onboarding survey asks the user if they're ready. (If they
  # have two eligible poeple, it'll ask *which* people on the account are
  # ready.) When they submit the form, an unresolved recommendation request is
  # created for each ready person.
  #
  # We used to have a DB column called 'people.ready' but it doesn't exist
  # anymore.  The 'readiness' language is now only used on the onboarding
  # survey, and it's just a front-end thing; under the hood it's all related to
  # RecommendationRequests.
  #
  # @!method self.call(params, options = {})
  #   @option params [String] person_type 'owner', 'companion', or 'both'.
  #     Raises an ArgumentError if it's something else.
