    # 'from' and 'to' are both strings in the format "Airport Name (XXX)" where
    # XXX is an IATA code. E.g. "London Heathrow (LHR)". On the front-end,
    # typeahead.js will fill the HTML <input> with a string in this format
    # which then gets submitted to the server. It's the back-end's job to make
    # sense of the string and figure out which airport they mean.
    #
    # Note that the user can still submit a blank string or an invalid one just
    # by typing into the text field without selecting any of the autocomplete
    # suggestions, so this error needs to be handled gracefully.
    #
    # Previously we were trying to do more on the frontend by having the JS
    # also update a hidden field with the airport's ID, and submitting that ID
    # to the server directly. Turns out that this approach didn't work in some
    # edge cases, so the current 'least bad' solution is to submit the full
    # string and let the server figure out the airport ID for itself.

    # The underlying TravelPlan model stores 'from' and 'to' in a nested
    # Flight (although for legacy reasons every TP only has one flight). The
    # simplest solution I could find was to make these virtual attributes
    # and build the flight 'manually' when syncing. (See also #prepopulate!)
