        # When we launch the MVP, this rake task will be used to add the initial
        # set of Cards, Currencies, and CardOffers.
        #
        # Here's how this list was created/chosen:
        #
        # 1. Scraped all card data from the Wallaby API - it's in
        #    `lib/data/wallaby_cards.json`. (Note that we only had a temporary
        #    sandbox API key which may have expired by the time you read this.)
        #
        # 2. Filtered out all cards except those that are from the following
        #    list of banks:
        #     - American Express
        #     - Bank of America
        #     - Barclays
        #     - Capital One
        #     - Chase
        #     - Citibank
        #     - Diners Club
        #     - Discover
        #     - SunTrust
        #     - TD Bank
        #     - US Bank
        #     - Wells Fargo
        #
        # 3. Erik reviewed the remaining cards manually to decide which cards
        #    to include.  He also found some offers for these cards - maximum
        #    one offer per card, some cards have no offer.
        #
        #    The CSV file below contains those selected cards and their offers.
        #    Each row of the CSV contains the details of one card, and
        #    optionally of one offer for that card:
        #
