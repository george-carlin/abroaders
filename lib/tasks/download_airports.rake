      # "New York, La Guardia",NYC,LGA

      # "NYC" is the general IATA code for all New York airports

      # "London",YXU,YXU

      # "London, Heathrow",LON,LHR

      # "London, Luton",LON,ETN
      # "London, Stansted",LON,STN

      # LON means London, England, while YXU means London, Ontario

      # This approach isn't perfect, however. See "Toronto" :
      #
      # "Toronto",YTO,YTO
      # "Toronto",YYZ,YYZ
      #
      # "YTO" is the metrocode for all of Toronto, while "YYZ" is Toronto
      # Pearson Airport. (There are other airports in Toronto, but they
      # aren't included in this dataset :( )
      #
      # We'll work around this by, in the rake task that saves Airports
      # and Cities to the DB, deleting any Cities that don't have any
      # child airports (which in this case would by YTO)
      #
      # Note that the list of 'metrocodes' (codes which cover more than one
      # airport) is actually fairly small, so if there are major issues we can
      # probably fix things up manually.
